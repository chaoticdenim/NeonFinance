# Neon Finance

This project aims to be a stocks analysis webapp.
In the future, it will provide customized tracking of stocks, as well as the ability to see financial technical indicators, all in a UI that looks _disco_. 

## Run

To run the app, simply navigate to the client folder and run `npm install` and then `npm start`. This will use the existing infrastructure I have set up (Lambda functions to periodically update the DB with market data, Nodejs server to serve back the data).
